# Nightlight

Shed light on the dark corners of your app

Nightlight helps you make sure all pages in your app are getting the love and attention they deserve

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nightlight'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nightlight

Run the install generator:

```sh
rails g nightlight:install
rake db:migrate
```

And mount the dashboard in your `config/routes.rb`:

mount Nightlight::Engine, at: "nightlight"
```

## Authentication

Donâ€™t forget to protect the dashboard in production.

### Basic Authentication
