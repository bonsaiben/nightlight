# Nightlight

Shed light on the dark corners of your app

Nightlight is an admin interface for tracking what pages are (not) being checked by your team

[Demo available here](http://nightlight-demo.herokuapp.com/nightlight)

## Features

- Indicate when you've checked a page and leave a comment (all good? bugs? link to Trello card?)
- See what pages haven't been checked in a while
- Sync with `GET` routes from `config/routes.rb`, or maintain your own list of pages
- Assign pages to yourself to check, and see who's already checking what
- Get a random page to check that nobody else is checking

## Benefits

- Keep fresh eyes on pages you don't see very often (onboarding, edge cases)
- Discover things your automated tests aren't catching (CSS bugs, typos, bad impressions, forgot-to-update-that-too's)
- Discover things that user feedback isn't catching
- Improve product quality and internal product awareness (each person check a random page every day?)
- Share page-level meta info across a team (useful notes, gotchyas, how-to's, please-don't's)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'nightlight'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nightlight

Run the install generator:

```sh
rails g nightlight:install
rake db:migrate
```

And mount the dashboard in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Nightlight::Engine, at: "nightlight"
```

## Authentication

Donâ€™t forget to protect the dashboard in production.

### Basic Authentication

Set the following variables in your environment or an initializer.

```ruby
ENV["NIGHTLIGHT_USERNAME"] = "ben"
ENV["NIGHTLIGHT_PASSWORD"] = "secret"
```

### Devise

```ruby
authenticate :user, lambda{|user| user.admin? } do
  mount Nightlight::Engine, at: "nightlight"
end
```
